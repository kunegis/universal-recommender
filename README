The Universal Recommender
=========================

This is an historical software package, meant as documentation, and not
to be run.  It is the Universal Recommender, a software library written
in the Java programming language, implementing many recommendation
algorithms and related methods. 

The Universal Recommender was written by me (Jérôme Kunegis) at the
Technische Universität Berlin in the timeframe 2009-2010, and was used
to implement evaluation for several academic papers. 

The material in this directory was aggregated in 2017 and comprises:

* README; this file, written in 2017 to document the package
* howto/; an unused draft of a howto document in PDF format
* whitepaper/; a high-level overview, as a PDF document, published at
  the time on arXiv as a whitepaper
* COPYING; The GPLv3, applied to this project in 2017.  The project was
  previously unpublished. 
* Everything else is part of the original code

The code is provided as is, without any guarantees.  In particular, it
has not been executed since 2010, and is written in the Java programming
language.  Beware that is contains many configuration files such as
'pom.xml' and '.project' which are highly specific to the GUI used to
write the software (Eclipse), and are unlikely to work nowadays.
