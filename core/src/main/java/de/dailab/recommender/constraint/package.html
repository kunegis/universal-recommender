  Methods for excluding certain results from recommendation lists.

<p>
There are two types of constraints:  Simple (class Constraint) and with memory (class RunningConstraint).  Simple
constraint only have an accept(Recommendation) method to decide whether a recommendation shall be accepted.
Running constraint have a build method that returns a Constraint object and can be used to implement a "memory"
in constraints, e.g. to implement the constraint that no two recommended TV programs have overlapping schedules.
Both constraint classes implement the marker interface GeneralConstraint, which is accepted by all constraint-used 
classes.
