  Prediction and recommendation using latent models.  Latent models internally compute a model
  of the data and can then be used for very fast prediction and recommendation.  Each latent predictor corresponds to one way 
  of decomposing the adjacency matrix.
  <p>
  Latent models of a network can be seen as decompositions of the network's adjacency matrix, e.g. the eigenvalue decomposition 
  or the singular value decomposition.
