	Sparse matrix and vector interface and implementation, optimized for fast iteration.
	Several in-memory representation types are supported.
	<p>
	All classes are sparse and are represented as separate vectors of index and value types.  Only
	native types are used.
	<p>
	MatrixFactory must be used to create matrices and vectors.
