Direct recommenders:  Recommenders that follows relationships directly.  They can be combined with other 
recommenders.  Example:  A social recommender usually follows "buddy" links and then uses a normal recommender
on the user-item relationship types.
<p>
Path recommender models are trivial.  They do not use any memory and don't require computations 
for building.  Recommendation itself however requires memory, depending on the path used and on
the graph topology.
